<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    This packet provides a high‑level overview of MediAxis system controls, security configurations,

<h2>Section 1 — Policy Summaries</h2>

<div class="section">

    <h3 class="subsection">Encryption Policy</h3>
    <p>
        MediAxis encrypts all data in transit using TLS 1.2+ and all stored data using industry‑standard
        encryption provided by our cloud infrastructure. No PHI is transmitted or stored without
        encryption.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Access Control Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Access to the MediAxis platform is role‑based. Clinic staff can only view or modify information
        appropriate to their assigned role. Administrative functions are restricted to authorized
        clinic administrators.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Authentication & MFA Policy</h3>
    <p>
        All users authenticate using secure, password‑based login. Multi‑factor authentication (MFA) is
        supported and will be required for administrative users as the platform expands.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Audit Logging Policy</h3>
    <p>
        MediAxis records key claim‑related actions, including creation, updates, and status changes.
        Logs include user ID, timestamp, and action type. Logs are immutable and retained for audit
        purposes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Session Timeout Policy</h3>
    <p>
        User sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity to reduce unauthorized access
        risk. Users must re‑authenticate to continue working.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Data Retention Policy</h3>
    <p>
        MediAxis retains claim‑related data only as long as required for operational and regulatory
        purposes. No PHI is included in this audit packet.
    </p>
